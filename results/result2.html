            <p>Animals usually blend into their natural background
                by producing colors similar to their natural surroundings.
                This technique is known as camouflage. It can be
                used both to protect animals against predators and to
                disguise animals hunting for prey. Camouflage makes it
                difficult to distinguish animals in the wild because their
                colors match those of their environment.
                Some animals change colors through multiple tiny physical structures. Just as
                a prism scatters visible light to reflect the colors of the rainbow, these structures
                convert available light into a particular mix of colors. Polar bears, for example,
                actually have black skin and clear hairs. But when light shines on a polar bear,
                each of its hairs bends the light, bouncing it around so that the animal appears
                white.
                Other animals actually change the color of their skin by producing pigments
                called biochromes. These pigments absorb some light waves and reflect others.
                Octopuses use biochromes to change not only the color of their skin but also the
                pattern. When an octopus feels threatened, it can seemingly disappear into the
                surrounding terrain.</p>
